**Project Goals, Skills, and Tools**
The basic class requirements for this project were to create an Android app that uses some sort of API, though in the end I actually used two different APIs. In addition to that, I wanted to make something that was useful but also fun. As a result, I made a fun way to motivate myself to read more.

Throughout this process, I developed a number of skills:
* Working with threads and efficency. Certain bits of code needed to be run over and over without completely bogging down the whole system. This required me to think about not just how to do things, but the best way to do them
* Thinking about the end user. Unlike most of my previous assignments, building an app comes with the implication that someone else will be using it. Similar to the above point, this forced me to think of the best way to display info to a user rather than finding something that works and putting up with the inconvience.

I also got experience with some new tools and software:
* Android Studio. This is the first app I ever developed, so I learned a lot about how apps are programmed and their lifecycle.
* JSON APIs. I didn't know anything about the JSON format or that they could be incorporated into Java code, so learning each API was also an adventure



**Reflection**
Going into this project, I didn't think I would learn as much as I did. I've been programming in Java for a couple years, so working on a project didn't seem daunting. However, you never know how much you don't know. This is the first mobile app I've created, so first I had to learn how to create an interface for the user, navigate between screens, activate buttons, and interact with the file system. I also didn't know how to incorporate the completely new-to-me format of JSON into Java. Overall, the coolest part of this project was taking something I thought I had down and pushing myself to see that there is so much more to learn.
